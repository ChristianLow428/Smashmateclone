-- Fix NextAuth Integration
-- This migration updates the schema to work with NextAuth user IDs instead of Supabase Auth

-- Drop existing foreign key constraints that reference auth.users

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_matches DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS tournament_matches_player1_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS matchmaking_players DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS matchmaking_players_user_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS match_chat_messages DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS match_chat_messages_sender_id_fkey;

-- Update matchmaking_players table to use NextAuth user IDs directly
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS matchmaking_players DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS user_id;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS matchmaking_players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS id TEXT PRIMARY KEY;

-- Update matches table to reference matchmaking_players directly
-- (This is already correct in the current schema)

-- Update match_chat_messages to use NextAuth user IDs
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS match_chat_messages DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sender_id;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS match_chat_messages ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sender_id TEXT NOT NULL;

-- Update tournament_participants to use NextAuth user IDs
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_participants DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS user_id;

-- Update tournament_matches to use NextAuth user IDs
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_matches DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS player1_id;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_matches DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS player2_id;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_matches DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS winner_id;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_matches ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS player1_id TEXT NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tournament_matches ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS player2_id TEXT NOT NULL;
